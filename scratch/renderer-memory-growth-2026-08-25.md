# Renderer memory growth — measured state, 2026-08-25

Resumption point, not a log. Force-added because redoing it costs hours of
live measurement against a session that no longer exists.

Written by `browser-perf` (`fleet:a8793364`). Everything below is measured
unless the line says otherwise.

## The report

Skip, 2026-08-25 ~05:20 EDT: *"performance of the app is like, not so good
sometimes"*, then *"we have a profiler in there yes?"*, then — after being shown
the numbers — *"yeah uh i have tried to argue this fuckign thing leaks dude /
nobody believes me"*.

He is right. It leaks.

## What the growth is

One browser tab, one project open, nobody touching it. Renderer process
footprint, sampled from outside the browser:

| time (UTC) | footprint |
|---|---|
| 05:27 | 2,459 MB |
| 05:32 | 2,899 MB |
| 05:48 | 4,510 MB |
| 06:01 | 6,555 MB |
| 06:09 | 7,830 MB |
| 06:14 | 8,823 MB |
| 06:29 | 11 GB |

Monotonic, and the rate roughly doubled over the hour — ~82 MB/min early,
~170 MB/min late. The machine has 8 GB.

## What it is not

Each ruled out by measurement, not by argument.

- **JS heap.** Flat, 100–193 MB throughout.
- **JS allocation.** `HeapProfiler` sampling with JS stacks: **6.3 MB of JS
  allocation in 240 seconds**, while the process grew several hundred MB. The
  memory is not being requested by our JavaScript.
- **Listener registrations.** `getEventListeners` on `window`, `document`,
  `body` and every element: `document` total 79 in both samples 90 s apart,
  `pointerdown` 14 in both.
- **`Documents` / `Nodes`.** These oscillate and come back down (17 → 10,
  8,006 → 7,156). An earlier reading of these as a monotonic trend was one
  sample pair caught on a rising edge — see *Corrections*.
- **Canvas.** Three canvases, 82 MB total. **Images:** zero.
- **Voice PCM backlog.** `PcmBacklog` trims at `maxBytes`, default 64 MB, and
  `voicePcmBacklogMaxBytes()` maps `≤ 0` to the default rather than to
  unlimited. Capped by construction.

## What it is

`Memory.getSamplingProfile` — **live** allocations, still held, not
allocate-and-free churn — over a 5-minute window in which the footprint went
7,830 → 8,823 MB:

```
2,284.8 MB   one single allocation site
  193.2 MB   V8 heap
   58.5 MB   next site down
   < 1.5 MB  everything else
```

memory-infra tracing, absolute breakdown of that renderer:

```
malloc            8,092 MB
shared_memory       857 MB
gpu                 849 MB
blink_gc            246 MB
v8                  226 MB
cc                  203 MB
partition_alloc      36 MB
skia                  1 MB
```

**8.1 GB sits in `malloc`** — Chrome's bucket for heap allocation it does not
attribute to any named subsystem. Not Blink GC, not V8, not compositor tiles,
not Skia, not PartitionAlloc.

**The allocation stack cannot be symbolized.** Four frames, three of them the
allocator; release Chrome is stripped and `atos` resolves every address to
`ChromeMain + <offset>`. There is no dSYM for a shipping Chrome build.

## Reproduction status

**Does not reproduce** on a disposable project. Fresh tab, real app, real
markdown page, real iframes, fleet panels; watched 7 minutes: RSS oscillates
92–131 MB, no trend.

That negative is trustworthy — the renderer was identified by allocating 400 MB
inside the page and confirming that process rose 392 MB. Two earlier attempts at
this control were worthless and are recorded here so nobody repeats them:

1. First attempt pointed at a project that **did not exist** — 404, 29 DOM
   nodes, nothing rendered. "Nothing happened" was the environment, not a
   finding.
2. The tab's fleet chat renders **zero** chat lines even on a working project,
   so the reproduction never had the thing Skip's session has most of.

**Unmatched conditions, and the two live candidates:** live chat traffic into a
loaded chat panel, and voice actually running. Note `isAutomatedBrowser()`
disables `useLongTaskProfileLog` in any automated tab, so the self-profiler
never runs in the reproduction and always runs in his.

## Corrections to things said out loud during this session

- **`migrateProjectParts` has callers.** It is reached from
  `migrateAllProjectParts(PROJECTS_DIR)` at `server/unified-server.mjs:10012`,
  once at server startup. The earlier "zero callers on main" came from a grep
  that excluded the defining file. Its 7 appearances in lag profiles over two
  days are **restarts**, not a periodic job.
- **The Radix call site is not the leak.** `@radix-ui/react-menu` adds a
  `pointerdown` and a `pointermove` on every keydown, but with `{ once: true }`
  and the same function reference, so the DOM ignores the duplicates —
  confirmed by `pointerdown` on `document` sitting at 14 across both samples.
  Counting `addEventListener` **calls** cannot answer a question about
  **registrations**.
- **The `WS request idle timeout` lines in `client.log` are mine**, from the
  automated tab. Two occurrences in the current rotation, both this hour. Not a
  user-facing symptom.

## Server, same session

`lag-profiler.log`, last 24 hours: **499 stalls**, median 271 ms, p90 358 ms,
p99 797 ms, max 933 ms. 12,317 dumps since 25 Jul.

- **~90% name no JavaScript at all** — the top frame is `(idle)` and the dump's
  stack is literally `["(idle) @ :0", "(root) @ :0"]`. The isolate ran nothing;
  the loop still lagged.
- The box is **not** saturated: 2 vCPU, load 0.67, PSI cpu `some avg300=3.67`,
  io `some avg300=1.59`. So contention is not the explanation. **Inference, not
  established:** time blocked in a native call outside V8, most likely
  synchronous filesystem IO on the volume.
- Server main thread RSS **1.3 GB** on a 4 GB machine. `fleet.db` is **10.9 GB**.
- `spawn` tops **28 of 499**. `existsSync`/`stat` under `migrateProjectParts`
  is startup-only. `broadcastFleet` → `utf8Write` costs 190–225 ms per stall it
  appears in; `broadcastFleet` stringifies once and sends the same string to
  every client, so that cost is per-socket UTF-8 encoding, scaling with payload
  × client count.
- Region is `sjc`; he is Eastern. ~70 ms round trip floor.

## The client profiler works and its output is unreadable

`client-profile.jsonl` is **268 MB, 3,975 self-profiles**, actively written.
Every deploy replaces `dist`, so the sourcemap for a bundle is gone as soon as
the next deploy lands. The last 400 records reference **13 distinct bundles and
not one of them is the live one** — **zero** are mappable.

Recent traces for one session: longest single main-thread block **4,382 ms**;
one frame is **24.5%** of all busy main-thread time and appears at the same
offset in two builds.

**Not built, deliberately.** Retaining maps across deploys is new machinery and
Skip's rule is to say it in one sentence before building it. The sentence would
be: *keep `dist/assets/index-*.js.map` on the volume, keyed by bundle hash, so
a profile posted from an older bundle can still be resolved.*

## Instrumentation left in his tab

None. The counting probe was uninstalled and confirmed removed. The native
sampler stopped itself. A `WebSocket` `bufferedAmount` watch was installed at
~06:35 and **must be uninstalled** — `node /tmp/cdp-ws.mjs uninstall`, script in
this session's scratchpad.

## Next action

Read the WebSocket buffer result. `bufferedAmount` is renderer-side malloc, is
invisible to the JS heap, lands in exactly the `malloc` bucket that holds the
8 GB, and is unbounded when a page sends faster than a socket drains. If that is
flat, the next step is to drive the reproduction toward his conditions — chat
traffic and voice on — until it grows, and take a heap snapshot there, where the
tab can be frozen for as long as it takes.
